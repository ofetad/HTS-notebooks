    "# MCT Racks\n",
    "For MCTs (eppendorf tubes) I would recommend this racks: <https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:1132367> \n",
    "\n",
    "For the Wet Lab we actually used this rack:\n",
    "<https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:319772>, but that is only because I printed them before the design I am recommending was available.  Trust me that it is a lot easier to shove the magnets in the hole designed to hold it than trying to glue the magnets into an indentation while the magnets are trying to jump off and stick to each other.\n",
    "# PCR Racks\n",
    "We used this rack for PCR tubes: <https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:3018910>.  There are three different models there, an 8-tube rack (4+4), a 12-tube rack (6+6), and a \"magnet shover\".  We used the 8-tube racks, mostly because I already had the magnets for them.\n",
    "\n",
    "These print great on the Ultimaker 3, but doesn't work on the Ultimaker 2 because the slots are slightly too small for the magnets. Could be due to slightly different default settings rather than the printer itself.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Magnets\n",
    "Recommended magnets are linked from the model pages on Thingiverse.\n",
    "\n",
