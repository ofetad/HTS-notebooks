    "## Using a *FASTQ* variable\n",
    "Most of the commands in our pipeline are complicated! To apply our pipeline to different FASTQs, we need to change things in multiple places.  For example, just to run trimming with fastq-mcf, we need to change things in two places between each run: the input FASTQ and the output FASTQ.  If we were doing this with paired-end reads, we would have to change four things. Doing this by hand is not only tedious, but error prone.  Doing almost the same thing repeatedly is something that people are bad at, but computers are very good at!  So let's get the computer to do the hard work.  Because the Bash shell is almost magical (it is a full fledged programming language), we can do this easily."
