    "This is appropriate in some situations, but often when there is a group of files that we want to work with, we can find a simple way to list these files without specifying them one-by-one.  For example, since the reads for each FASTQ are split across four lanes, we might want to analyze the data from all four lanes at once.  There are several ways that we can specify the FASTQs from all four lanes of FASTQ 27_MA:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. The easiest is to use the `*` wildcard, which matches any number of any characters (including zero), so we can match the FASTQs from all four lanes like this: `$RAW_FASTQS/27_MA*`\n",
    "2. `*` is easy and useful, but often it is better to be more specific, otherwise we might match something unintentionally. Since the only difference in the names between the lanes is the \"L001\", \"L002\", \"L003\", and \"L004\", we can narrow our match using `?`, which matches any single character: `27_MA_P_S38_L00?_R1_001.fastq.gz`\n",
    "3. The best approach is to specify exactly what characters we are allowing in that variable position.  Square brackets allow you to list specific characters that can match `[1234]` or a range `[1-4]`: `27_MA_P_S38_L00[1-4]_R1_001.fastq.gz`\n",
    "\n",
